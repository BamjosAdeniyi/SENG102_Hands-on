2.Semantic HTML is the use of appropriately tagged content that will give meaning or context to the content itself, as opposed to simply determining how the content will be displayed visually. The use of semantic tags provide browsers, developers, and assistive technologies such as screen readers with context for the content that can be accessed on the web. Examples of semantic tags are  <header/> and <footer/>

Importance Of Semantics In HTML

1) Increased accessibility: Individuals with visual impairments will benefit from being able to utilize screen readers and other assistive technologies that rely on semantics to navigate webpages.

2) Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO) : Search engines such as Google look to semantics to help them understand the order and structure of the content on websites and will provide the website with higher search engine ranking.

3) Greater Code Readability & Maintenance : Developers will be able to read and understand other developers code more easily than if it was not semantically tagged, facilitating teamwork between developers.

4) Enhanced Consistency and Future Proofing : When the internet continues to evolve and new devices and browsers become available, semantically tagged websites will continue to function uniformly across all devices without the need for extensive code refactoring or rewriting.

5) Improved Mobile Compatibility : Mobile devices will be able to process semantically tagged content much better and more efficiently than other types of content.
