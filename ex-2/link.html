    <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply <b>dummy text</b> of the printing and <strong>typesetting industry</strong>. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <hr><br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <i>Letraset sheets</i> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p></br></hr>
