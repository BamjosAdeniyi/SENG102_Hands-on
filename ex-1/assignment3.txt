Do a little research on Semantic HTML structure. 
Study an article and provide the list below using your own words.

1. Explain the concept.
2. Explain the importance.
3. Explain what each element in the semantic structure represents. (Can be done with a picture).

Add the link to your GeekforGeeks article to your .md file and word document.

Here is a paraphrased version of your notes, refined for better flow and clarity while maintaining the technical accuracy of each element.

Understanding Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML refers to markup that conveys the structural meaning of web content rather than just its visual appearance. By using these specific tags, you provide a clear roadmap for both the browser and the developer, explicitly defining what kind of information each section contains. Essentially, the code speaks for itself.

Why Semantics Matter
Switching from generic containers (like <div>) to semantic elements offers several key advantages:

Enhanced Accessibility: Screen readers use these tags to help visually impaired users navigate a page more intuitively.

SEO Optimization: Search engines can better index your site when they understand which parts are headers, articles, or navigation menus.

Code Longevity: Meaningful tags make the codebase cleaner and easier for teams to maintain or update.

Structural Clarity: It creates a consistent hierarchy that makes the document's logic obvious at a glance.

Core Semantic Elements and Their Roles
Element	Purpose & Description
<header>	Acts as the introductory container for a page or section, typically holding logos or headings.
<nav>	Reserved for major blocks of navigation links, such as menus or tables of contents.
<main>	Identifies the primary, unique content of the document. There should only be one per page.
<section>	Groups related content together into distinct thematic chapters or areas.
<article>	Wraps self-contained content that could make sense on its own (e.g., a blog post, a tweet, or a forum entry).
<aside>	Used for content indirectly related to the main text, often displayed as sidebars or call-out boxes.
<footer>	Found at the base of a page or section; usually contains copyright info, sitemaps, or contact details.
<figure> / <figcaption>	Encapsulates media (like images or charts) and provides a specific caption for that media.
<details> / <summary>	Creates an interactive widget that the user can expand to see more info. <summary> acts as the visible label.
<form>	Defines a section containing interactive controls for submitting user data.
<table>	Specifically used for rendering data in a structured grid of rows and columns.
<mark>	Programmatically highlights a portion of text
