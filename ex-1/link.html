    <p> Lorem Ipsum is  <b>simply dummy </b>text of the  <strong>printing</strong> and typesetting industry. 
        <em>Lorem Ipsum </em>  has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <i>specimen</i> book. <hr/> <br/>
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <i> Letraset sheets</i> containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
         and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
        including versions of <em Lorem Ipsum.></em>
