    <p>This is my first hypertext file</p>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <strong>printing</strong> 
        and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
        industry's standard <b>dummy</b> text ever since the 1500s, 
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
        scrambled it to make a type <i>specimen</i> book. <hr/> <br/>It has 
        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
         into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
          It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
           Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like
             Aldus PageMaker including versions of <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>.</p>
