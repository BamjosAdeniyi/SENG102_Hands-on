The <strong> tag is used to indicate that the text is important or has strong emphasis. Although it usually appears bold in browsers, its main purpose is to provide semantic meaning. Search engines and screen readers recognize <strong> as important content.

In summary, <b> is used for visual bold text, while <strong> is used for important text with semantic meaning.

In summary, <i> is used for italic styling only, while <em> is used to emphasize text with semantic meaning.

What is Semantic HTML
