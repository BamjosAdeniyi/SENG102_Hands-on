## ANSWER

### 1. Concept

Semantic HTML elements are simply elements with meaning. The use and definition of semantic HTML elements in the code tells the browser and the developer what they are supposed to do. In simpler words, these elements describe the type of content they are supposed to contain. Semantic elements provide meaningful tags that clearly describe their purpose, thereby improving readability and accessibility.
