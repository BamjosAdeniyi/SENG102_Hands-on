What Is the concept of semantic HTML?

The concept of semantic HTML is to use the elements of HTML that are ones which tell about what is contained in the element and not merely influence the appearance in the browser. That is, the tag itself informs the developer and the browser as to the nature of the content contained within the tag.

The Importance of semantic HTML?

Semantic HTML is not a developer craze: it is actually a structural advantage:

Accessibility: The page is easier to interpret through the use of the screen reader and assistive technology.

SEO: The search engines get to know more of what you are talking about and this aids in ranking and indexing.

Readability: You (or your teammate) will be able to read the markup like a roadmap in the future.

Maintainability: It is easier to update clean logical sections.
